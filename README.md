<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I started running some time ago.
After I had some experience under my belt I started looking for ways to improve,
for that to happen I needed some way to calculate and plan out my run, so I was looking for good 
running calculator.
Unfortunately, most of them out there lack functions that I needed.
That's why I created my own!

For now it can:
* Calculate average pace that you need to achieve to run specific distance in given time.
* Calculate total time based on average pace that you want to achieve.
* Calculate average pace from average pace of 1km splits. 
`This option is my favorite as you can plan out your run so you achieve average pace that you want! I like to start slow and ramp up as the run goes, with help of this tool I know how much faster do I need to run to achieve certain pace.`
* Convert your pace to speed.

More features may be added in the future!

### Built With
